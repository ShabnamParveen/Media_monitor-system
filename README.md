# media monitor system
In this project I attempted to contribute to the media monitor technology through a research project that is divided into two parts. First, I aimed to identify fake reviews. Then, using machine learning and deep learning models, I attempted to rank feedback and classify it according to the customer's sentiment. This ranking system would help companies to focus on the most important feedback that impacts their growth and sales. I utilized random forest, xgboost, and LSTM models for this project, and the LSTM model produced the highest accuracy of 0.90 after only 30 epochs of training. Therefore, the LSTM model was deemed the most effective for this project.
